Game Library is a static landing page with various videogames listed through a JSON database via JavaScript, you are able to sort the games by:

- Latest (latest ID, as in the last game "uploaded")
- Name (alphabetically from A-Z)
- Year (From oldest to newest game, as in release date)

All of this is changed in real time with the help of **AJAX**.
